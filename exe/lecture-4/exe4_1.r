################# write function  ###############
#################################################
###### a first exercise to learn how to write functions
###### to let R do several operations at the same time
###### for this exercise you need to select several
###### columns in the WVS dataset. Do not select less than
###### 5 but also not more than 
###### 10 columns as this unnecessarily complicates
###### the exercise.

# 1. calculate the means of the variables
# fist set the missing values to NA
# a) create function without loop (for each variable separately)





# b) do this using a for loop within function






# c) use a preprogrammed function colMeans to 
# calculate the means across a preselected set of
# columns
# set missing values first to NA!




# d) use a preprogrammed function apply to 
# calculate the means across a preselected set of
# columns
# use na.rm argument to deal with missings
# look up function ?apply!
