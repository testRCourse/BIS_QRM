# 1. estimate a model with one ordinal variable to explain 
# satisfaction (you can choose from eduR or ageR)

# a) include the variable as it is now in the model (so as numeric value,
# if you already changed it to a factor variable, change it back to numeric
# by as.numeric()
# interpret the intercept and coefficient




# b) recode the variable so that the lower level is a zero
# TIP create a new variable so you still have the original variable
# compare the results with the one you obtained above
# interpret the intercept and coefficient





# c) estimate the model with the ordinal variable as a factor 
# include the factor( ) command in the lm command
# interpret the intercept and coefficient




#______________________ OPTIONAL ______________________________#
# d) plot the two variables using plot()
# include the effect estimated with the lm function
# TIP you need to include two lines! look at $coefficients
# obtained with the lm function
