dataSet[,"inc_dummy"]<- dataSet$dummy * dataSet$income

# check your new variable
table(dataSet$inc_dummy)
table(dataSet$income[dataSet$country==840])

# b. estimate the multiple regression equation with interaction term
# interpret the effects
# NOTE build up your model, add a varaible at the time
# and see if you can still interpret each coefficient
# once you add the variables


# step 1: only income
summary(lm(satis~income, data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0
# note that income=0 is a hypothetical value (as it runs from 1 to 10)
# the coefficient represents the effect of a one-point increase in income
# on satisfaction, i.e. with each income level increase satisfaction increases by .23
# NOTE: you test the model now on the entire sample (listwise deletion is default in R:
# the cases with missing values on satis, income or both are excluded)

# step 2: income and dummy
summary(lm(satis~income + dummy, data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0 and dummy=0
# thus people in the USA with income of zero has on average a satisfaction levle of 6.20 
# the coefficient represents the effect of a one-point increase in income
# on satisfaction, i.e. with each income level increase satisfaction increases by .20975
# holding the dummy constant, i.e. for each level of dummy, 
# i.e. for people in the USA as well as NL one-point increase in income leads to 
# an .20975 increase in satisfaction
# dummy coefficient shows that people in the NL (=1) have .796 higher satisfaction then people in the USA (=0) 
# holding income constant, thus for each level of income
# NOTE: you test the model now on people from the two countries with NO missing values on satis and income

# step 3: include the interaction effect
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0
summary(lm(satis~income + dummy + inc_dummy, data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0 and dummy=0 (and thus no interaction)
# thus people in the USA with income of zero has on average a satisfaction levle of 5.929 
# the coefficient represents the effect of a one-point increase in income
# on satisfaction, i.e. with each income level increase satisfaction increases by .1439
# for when dummy is zero, i.e. for people in the USA a one-point increase in income leads to 
# an .1439 increase in satisfaction
# the dummy coefficient shows that people in the NL (= 1) have 1.290 higher satisfaction then people in the USA (=0) 
# for when income is zero.


## c. assess model fit for multiple regression
# The adjusted R2 increases with adding each step a variable to the model
# NOTE. this might not be the case if the explained variance by the added variable is very low (but still significant)
# overall, an added variable with a significant efect on the dependent variable
# will lead to a higher adjusted R2.


# R2 adjusted for model 1: .05155
# R2 adjusted for model 2: .07833
# R2 adjusted for model 3: .08288
# the last model has the most explained variance
# of all the variation in the dependent variable, 8% is explained by
# the independent variables

##################### mean centering ####################
#########################################################
# a. center your independent variables around a meaningful value
dataSet$mincome <- dataSet$income - mean(dataSet$income, na.rm=TRUE)
# I take the mean here, as the average income level is interesting to
# country level statistics. Other possible meaningful values could be
# the first value or the last value. For example, if you want to 
# measure the effect of time (measured in months) on sales, you could take the 
# the first value as a reference. Then the intercept represents the
# mean sales for the first month, and the coefficient the increase of sales with
# each month (month being a variable numbered from 1 to 12). This would be called
# first value centering.

# check your new variable
summary(dataSet$mincome)
table(round(dataSet$mincome, digits=3))
table(dataSet$income,round(dataSet$mincome, digits=3)) # compare with original values

# compare across countries included in the analysis
table(dataSet$dummy,round(dataSet$mincome, digits=3))


# b. calculate the interaction term using the centered values
# add the interaction term to the independent variables
dataSet$minc_dummy <- dataSet$dummy * dataSet$mincome

# check your new variables
summary(dataSet$minc_dummy)
table(round(dataSet$minc_dummy, digits=3))
table(dataSet$dummy,round(dataSet$minc_dummy, digits=3))


# compare the variable across countries
table(dataSet$dummy,round(dataSet$mincome_dummy, digits=3))


# c. conduct multiple regression to test interaction with lm function
# interpret the effects
# compare to uncentered solution and the centered solution without interaction term

# step 1: only income
summary(lm(satis~mincome , data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0
# note that income=0 is now the average level of income 
# thus: the people with an average income have on average a 6.673 level of satisfaction
# the coefficient represents the effect of a one-point increase in income
# on satisfaction, i.e. with each income level increase satisfaction increases by .23
# NOTE; this remains the same as before: a one-point increase is still the same

# step 2: income and dummy
summary(lm(satis~mincome + dummy, data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0 and dummy=0
# note that income=0 is now the average level of income 
# thus: the people in the USA with an average income have on average a 7.161 level of satisfaction
# the coefficient represents the effect of a one-point increase in income
# on satisfaction, i.e. with each income level increase satisfaction increases by .20975
# holding the dummy constant, i.e. for each level of dummy, 
# i.e. for people in the USA as well as NL one-point increase in income leads to 
# an .20975 increase in satisfaction
# dummy coefficient shows that people in the NL (=1) have .796 higher satisfaction then people in the USA (=0) 
# holding income constant, thus for each level of income

# step 2: add interaction effect 
summary(lm(satis~mincome + dummy + minc_dummy, data=dataSet))
# the intercept represents the mean level of satisfaction for income=0 and dummy=0 (and thus no interaction)
# thus people in the USA with an average income have on average a satisfaction level of 7.136
# the income coefficient shows that an increase of one-point in income leads 
# to a .264 higher satisfaction BUT now for only for dummy =0! Thus, only for the USA
# i.e. for people in the USA a one-point increase in income leads to 
# an .264 increase in satisfaction
# the dummy coefficient shows that an increase of one-point, i.e. for people in the NL (= 1) leads 
# to a 1.290 higher satisfaction compared to the USA for when income =0
# i.e. for people at all levels of income the NL is 1.290 more satisfied than the USA
# the interaction coefficient shows that an increase of one-point in income leads 
# to a .12 lower satisfaction for people in the NL (= 1) 
# compared to a one-point increase in income for people in the USA (=0)
