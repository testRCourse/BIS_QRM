###### up to now we have worked with the WVS dataset
###### with the country codes (i.e. numbers)
###### we will now attach the country labels (i.e. names)
###### to the WVS dataset
###### for this exercise you need to combine two datasets 
###### to attach the country names to the dataset

# 1. create a loop to attach the country codes to the dataset
# for this loop you need to select each country code in the dataset
# and select the same country code in the file with country names
# and connect these two together
# to do this follow the following steps:


# a) read file with countrycodes : countrycodes.txt



# b) create loop to 'read' all countrycodes in dataset



# c) fetch all the rows with the first countrycode
# using an if loop



# d) create loop to read the country codes in countrycodes.txt



# e) write the country name associated with this
# countrycode in countrycodes.txt to the dataset 
# for only those rows with the same countrycode
